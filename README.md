# Float4096 Library — The Mad Scientist’s Computational Playground

Float4096 is a revolutionary Java library that fuses **mathematics, symbolic physics, biology, and computation** into a single, coherent ecosystem. It’s not just a library — it’s a **computational art installation**.

## Key Highlights

- **4096-bit High-Precision Numbers:** Every number doubles as a **DNA sequence, Unicode glyph, and symbolic representation** of physical constants.
- **Turing-Complete DNA Language:** Program with **quaternary DNA codons** to perform loops, recursion, input/output, and symbolic computation.
- **Recursive Physics Engine:** Constants like Planck’s, G, and Boltzmann are treated as **Fibonacci- and PHI-scaled symbolic structures**, allowing numeric and symbolic physics to intertwine.
- **Immutable, Holographic Ledgers:** Branching, version-controlled ledgers ensure **data integrity and cryptographically inspired workflows**.
- **Elegant Integration Across Domains:** Math, biology, programming, and visualization coexist seamlessly, producing a **holistic symbolic-computational framework**.

## Why It’s Unique

Float4096 is a **mad scientist’s lab in code** — audacious, recursive, and beautifully structured. It empowers experimental exploration of **numbers as code, code as DNA, and computation as a living symbolic system**. It’s ideal for:

- Symbolic mathematics and physics exploration  
- Genetic algorithm and DNA-inspired computation  
- High-precision experimental programming  
- Conceptual computing and computational art  

**Float4096** isn’t just software — it’s a portal into **recursive, symbolic, and holographic computation**.
